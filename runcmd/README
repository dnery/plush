We made the modifications related to:
1)  execution;
2)  exec reporting.
3)  file redirection.

But we cannot solve the last case of execution, unfortunately
also we had problems linking the project.


##FIXED
And we wish to set a meeting to discuss about this problems, if it's possible.

We appreciate your attention.
