~~KEEP CALM AND CARRY ON~~

##Objectives
  We intend to develop a shell, during 2016's OS-2 course

##Rebooting Project
  Due to problems with the approach done, we're rebuilding it.


##Shue - Director's Cut

##Topics:
### 1. Define Structures for:
    .1 Buffering;
    .2 Pipelining;

### 2. Write the parser
  Get a new parser for our project - it has to deal with:
    .1 Find all symbols;
    .2 Adjust every symbol and argument properly for the structures above.

### 3. Marks to be set
    .1 Things done - They doesn't need changes
      Autotools port;
    .2 To be rearranged:
      Execution; Redirection, Non-Blocking execution (&);
    .3 To be set up now
      Pipeline("|"),Signal Handler.
